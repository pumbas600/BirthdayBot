# Birthday Bot

A simple bot that I made for my brothers birthday to try annoy him with lots of pings. It's built using my custom framework for JDA, [Halpbot](https://github.com/pumbas600/Halpbot).
The bot allows you to target users in a discord. Any message that tags them will then cause the bot to respond with a random message. The aim is to try and collect all the possible birthday messages.

There are currently **35** different messages that can be collected.
